This is a chat client and server I made for me and my friends.
This is made in Java and one of the reasons was to play around with
"Look and Feel"s. The main reason I made, however, is procrastination.

I use a great look and feel I downloaded, the licence of the look and feel uis in the file `LICENCE.txt`.
